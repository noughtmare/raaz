-- $memorysubsystem$
--
-- Cryptographic operations often need to keep sensitive information
-- like private keys in its memory space. Such sensitive information
-- can leak to the external would if the memory where the data is
-- stored is swapped out to a disk. What makes this particularly
-- dangerous is that the data can reside on the disk almost
-- permanently and might even survive when the hardware is
-- scrapped. The primary purpose of the memory subsystem is to provide
-- a way to allocate and manage /secure memory/, i.e. memory that will
-- not be swapped out as long as the memory is used and will be wiped
-- clean after use. It consists of the following components:
--
-- [The `Memory` type class:] A memory element is some type that holds
-- an internal buffer inside it.
--
-- [The `Alloc` type:] Memory elements need to be allocated and this
-- is involves a lot of low lever pointer arithmetic. The `Alloc`
-- types gives a high level interface for memory allocation. For a
-- memory type `mem`, the type `Alloc mem` can be seen as the
-- _allocation strategy_ for mem. For example, one of the things that
-- it keeps track of is the space required to create an memory element
-- of type `mem`. There is a natural applicative instance for `Alloc`
-- which helps build the allocation strategy for a compound memory
-- type from its components in a modular fashion _without_ explicit
-- size calculation or offset computation.
--
-- [`MemoryThread`s:] Instances of this class are actions that use
-- some kind of memory elements inside it. Such a thread can be run
-- using the combinator `securely` or the combinator `insecurely`. If
-- one use the combinator `securely`, then the allocation of the
-- memory element to be used by the action is done using a locked
-- memory pool which is wiped clean before de-allocation.

-- $init-extract$
--
-- Memory elements often needs to be initialised. Similarly data needs
-- to be extracted out of memory. An instance declaration
-- @`Initialisable` mem a@ for the memory type @mem@ indicates that it
-- can be initialised with the pure value @a@. Similary, if values of
-- type @b@ can be extracted out of a memory element @mem@, we can
-- indicate it with an instance of @`Extractable` mem a@.
--
-- There is an inherent danger in initialising and extracting pure
-- values out of memory. Pure values are stored on the Haskell heap
-- and hence can be swapped out. Consider a memory element @mem@ that
-- stores some sensitive information, say for example the unencrypted
-- private key. Suppose we extract this key out of the memory element
-- as a pure value before its encryption and storage into the key
-- file. It is likely that the key is swapped out to the disk as the
-- extracted key is part of the the haskell heap.
--
-- The `InitialiseFromBuffer` (`ExtractableToBuffer`) class gives an
-- interface for reading from (writing to) buffers directly minimising
-- the chances of inadvertent exposure of sensitive information from
-- the Haskell heap due to swapping.


-- | An action of type @`MT` mem a@ is an action that uses internally
-- a single memory object of type @mem@ and returns a result of type
-- @a@. All the actions are performed on a single memory element and
-- hence the side effects persist. It is analogues to the @ST@ monad.
type MT mem = ReaderT mem IO

-- | A class that captures abstract "memory threads". A memory thread
-- can either be run `securely` or `insecurely`. Pure IO actions can
-- be run inside a memory thread using the @runIO@.  However, the IO
-- action that is being run /must not/ directly or indirectly run a
-- `secure` action ever. In particular, the following code is bad.
--
-- > -- BAD EXAMPLE: DO NOT USE.
-- > runIO $ securely $ foo
-- >
--
-- On the other hand the following code is fine
--
-- >
-- > runIO $ insecurely $ someMemoryAction
-- >
--
-- As to why this is dangerous, it has got to do with the fact that
-- @mlock@ and @munlock@ do not nest correctly. A single @munlock@ can
-- unlock multiple calls of @mlock@ on the same page.  Whether a given
-- @IO@ action unlocks memory is difficult to keep track of; for all
-- you know, it might be a FFI call that does an @memunlock@. Hence,
-- currently there is no easy way to enforce this.
--

class MonadMemoryT mT where

  -- a limit to how much locked memory can be allocated. Nonetheless,
  -- actions that work with sensitive information like passwords should
  -- use this to run an memory action.

type AllocField = Field Pointer

-- | A memory allocator for the memory type @mem@. The `Applicative`
-- instance of @Alloc@ can be used to build allocations for
-- complicated memory elements from simpler ones.

-- | Make an allocator for a given memory type.
makeAlloc :: LengthUnit l => l -> (Pointer -> mem) -> Alloc mem
makeAlloc l memCreate = TwistRF (WrapArrow memCreate) $ atLeast l

-- | Allocates a buffer of size @l@ and returns the pointer to it pointer.
pointerAlloc :: LengthUnit l => l -> Alloc Pointer
pointerAlloc l = makeAlloc l id

---------------------------------------------------------------------

-- | Any cryptographic primitives use memory to store stuff. This
-- class abstracts all types that hold some memory. Cryptographic
-- application often requires securing the memory from being swapped
-- out (think of memory used to store private keys or passwords). This
-- abstraction supports memory securing. If your platform supports
-- memory locking, then securing a memory will prevent the memory from
-- being swapped to the disk. Once secured the memory location is
-- overwritten by nonsense before being freed.
--
-- While some basic memory elements like `MemoryCell` are exposed from
-- the library, often we require compound memory objects built out of
-- simpler ones. The `Applicative` instance of the `Alloc` can be made
-- use of in such situation to simplify such instance declaration as
-- illustrated in the instance declaration for a pair of memory
-- elements.

----------------------- Initialising and Extracting stuff ----------------------

-- | Memories that can be initialised with a pure value. The pure
-- value resides in the Haskell heap and hence can potentially be
-- swapped. Therefore, this class should be avoided if compromising
-- the initialisation value can be dangerous. Consider using
-- `InitialiseableFromBuffer`
--

class Memory m => Initialisable m v where
  initialise :: v -> MT m ()

-- | Memories from which pure values can be extracted. Once a pure value is
-- extracted,
class Memory m => Extractable m v where
  extract  :: MT m v


-- | Apply the given function to the value in the cell. For a function @f :: b -> a@,
-- the action @modify f@ first extracts a value of type @b@ from the
-- memory element, applies @f@ to it and puts the result back into the
-- memory.
--
-- > modify f = do b          <- extract
-- >               initialise $  f b
--
modify :: (Initialisable mem a, Extractable mem b) =>  (b -> a) -> MT mem ()
modify f = extract >>= initialise . f

-- | A memory type that can be initialised from a pointer buffer. The initialisation performs
-- a direct copy from the input buffer and hence the chances of the
-- initialisation value ending up in the swap is minimised.
class Memory m => InitialisableFromBuffer m where
  initialiser :: m -> ReadM (MT m)

-- | A memory type that can extract bytes into a buffer. The extraction will perform
-- a direct copy and hence the chances of the extracted value ending
-- up in the swap space is minimised.
class Memory m => ExtractableToBuffer m where
  extractor :: m -> WriteM (MT m)

--------------------- Some instances of Memory --------------------
